NearSide
========
Because we make for sense than The Far Side.

Description: a package for processing antenna near-field data.

Install
=======

**Ubuntu:**

NearSide uses NumPy so you need to decide if you want to build it yourself with

    $ sudo pip install numpy

or download the package with

    $ sudo apt-get install python-numpy

I have been building NumPy using the pip method, but it takes a long time. 

Once you have NumPy, install NearSide with 

    $ sudo pip install nearside (COMMING SOON)
    
**Windows:**
Make sure you have Numpy on your machine, then

    $ pip install nearside (COMMING SOON)


Contributing
